# CompSci
read the readme in the react js folder
INSTALL NODE PACKAGE MANAGER, find a tutorial which teaches you how to make a react app, and install everything necessary. No need to make a new app, just necessary software

After installing github desktop, clone the repository.

Then using the terminal go to the directory with the react js project. Type in npm i
Cd into compsci and type in npm start. 
The website should pop up. Yay!
